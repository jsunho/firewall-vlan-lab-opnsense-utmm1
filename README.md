**Short Summary**  

This lab simulates a multi-network environment using OPNsense, VLANs, DHCP, DNS, and firewall rules.  
The goal was to understand segmentation, routing, virtualization on macOS M1, and real-world firewall administration.  
It includes full documentation, configuration examples, and a reproducible setup.

**Skills Demonstrated**

  - VLAN configuration
  - Inter-VLAN routing
  - DHCP & DNS setup
  - Firewall rule design
  - Virtualization troubleshooting
  - Documentation best practices


# Firewall + VLAN Lab (OPNsense on UTM / macOS M1)

This project documents a fully isolated network lab using OPNsense, UTM, and multiple virtual networks.
The environment simulates a small-business infrastructure with segmented LAN and GUEST networks, firewall rules, DHCP, DNS, and controlled routing paths.

The goal of this lab is to practice real-world system integration skills: network design, segmentation, firewall administration, virtualization, and troubleshooting.


## 1. Architecture Overview

The lab consists of:
  - 1× OPNsense Firewall (amd64, emulated on Apple Silicon)
  - 1× LAN client VM (ARM64 Linux)
  - 1× GUEST client VM (ARM64 Linux)
  - 3 virtual networks in UTM:
    - WAN → NAT to macOS (internet access)
    - LAN → internal network (trusted)
    - GUEST → isolated network (restricted)

This setup mirrors infrastructure commonly found in small and medium-sized organizations.

## 2. Network Topology

## 3. Addressing Plan

LAN Network
  - Subnet: 192.168.10.0/24
  - Gateway: 192.168.10.1 (OPNsense LAN interface)
  - DHCP: provided later by OPNsense
  - Purpose: main internal network for trusted clients

GUEST Network
  - Subnet: 192.168.20.0/24
  - Gateway: 192.168.20.1 (OPNsense OPT1 interface)
  - DHCP: provided later by OPNsense
  - Purpose: isolated guest environment with restricted access

WAN Network
  - Provided by UTM (NAT)
  - DHCP from host → used for internet access

## 6. Key Learnings and Concepts

During the project I worked with:
  - Virtualization vs. emulation on Apple Silicon
  - UTM networking (Shared vs. Isolated mode)
  - Assigning interfaces in OPNsense (evtnet0, vtnet1, vtnet2)
  - Static IP configuration and subnetting
  - DHCP, DNS, and routing fundamentals
  - Writing firewall rules (allow/deny policies, segmentation)
  - Testing connectivity (ping, traceroute, DNS tests)
  - Using and securing the OPNsense WebGUI
  - Creating reproducible documentation

These are all relevant to real-world system administration and system integration work.

## Goals of the Project

- Build a functional firewall and multi-network lab
- Understand network segmentation and access control
- Practice using a professional firewall system
- Prepare for real-world IT infrastructure environments
- Document the project clearly and reproducibly

## Notes

Some components (especially OPNsense) require x86_64 emulation on Apple Silicon.
This is expected and part of the learning experience.
